# Daily Practice Workflow

## How This Works

### 1. Problem Assignment (Start of Day)
- You'll receive 2 problems to solve
- Each problem file includes:
  - Full problem description
  - Examples and test cases
  - Constraints
  - Subtle hints (if you need them)

### 2. Learning Phase
- Research the pattern/theory independently
- Understand the problem constraints
- Think about edge cases
- Plan your approach before coding

### 3. Implementation
- Write your solution in the provided Java file
- Test with the provided test cases
- Add your own test cases if needed
- Run: `javac FileName.java && java FileName`

### 4. Getting Help (If Stuck)
- Try for at least 20-30 minutes on your own
- If stuck, ask for hints
- Hints will be progressively more detailed
- Never jump straight to the solution

### 5. Code Review
- Once your solution works, request a review
- Review will cover:
  - Correctness
  - Time/Space complexity
  - Code quality and readability
  - Edge cases
  - Alternative approaches

### 6. Commit & Push
- After approval, the solution gets committed
- PROGRESS.md is updated automatically
- Push to GitHub to track your streak

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/dev/sandbox/leetcode-practice

# Compile and run a solution
javac 01-arrays-and-hashing/Easy_001_TwoSum.java
java -cp 01-arrays-and-hashing Easy_001_TwoSum

# Check status
git status

# See progress
cat PROGRESS.md
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Consistency > Speed** - Focus on understanding, not just solving
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Note similarities between problems
3. **Time Yourself** - Aim for 30-45 min per problem max
4. **Write Clean Code** - Practice like it's a real interview
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Don't just test happy paths
6. **Document Learnings** - Add comments explaining your approach

## Progress Tracking

Your GitHub contribution graph will show your daily commitment. Each day's work is tracked in PROGRESS.md with pattern completion statistics.
