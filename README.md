# LeetCode Practice - Daily DSA Journey

Daily practice repository for mastering data structures and algorithms in preparation for technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Goal
Solve 2 LeetCode problems daily, progressing from easy/medium to hard difficulty, with focus on pattern recognition and problem-solving fundamentals.

## Structure

This repository is organized by problem patterns rather than difficulty levels, as pattern recognition is key to solving interview problems efficiently.

## Problem Naming Convention

Each solution follows this format:
```
<difficulty>_<problem-number>_<problem-name>.java
```

Example: `Easy_001_TwoSum.java`

## Practice Approach

1. **Understand** - Read the problem thoroughly, identify the pattern
2. **Plan** - Think through the approach before coding
3. **Implement** - Write clean, working code
4. **Test** - Verify with multiple test cases
5. **Optimize** - Consider time/space complexity improvements
6. **Review** - Document learnings and edge cases

## Progress Tracking

See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for daily problem log and pattern completion status.

## Language
All solutions are implemented in **Java**.

## Commitment
Consistent daily practice to build strong problem-solving fundamentals and pattern recognition skills.
